We need three style changes in the web page provided for this task.

1. The navigation menu which has names 

        Product Development DNA
        Technology Focus
        Technology Partners
        About Persistent
		
	should be given style of { font-size: 20px; }
	
2. The client name Dave shall be given style {font-size: 22px;}

3. The client designation shall be given style of { font-size: 26px; }	

4. The styles shall be applied by a <style> tag placed in the <head> section of the page.  You shall use contextual CSS selectors to achieve this.  For example when we want to apply style to some A tag which is inside DIV having class "normal" we make a selector like 

div.normal a { <awesone style here> }

5. Fork the repository https://github.com/tusharvjoshi/frontendninja in your account using the Fork button on that repository.
